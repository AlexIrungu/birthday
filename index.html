        Dear Anne,

Today is a special day, as we celebrate another year of your life. As your sibling, I have had the privilege of watching you grow into a remarkable woman who inspires those around her with your kindness, intelligence, and grace. </p>

 <p>On this occasion, I want you to know that you are more than just a sister to me. You are a true friend, confidant, and ally who has always been there for me through thick and thin. Your unwavering support and love have been a source of strength for me, and I feel blessed to have you in my life.</p>

<p>As you enjoy the new year,
     I hope that you know how much you are loved and appreciated.
      May this year be filled with all the joy, happiness, and success that you deserve.
       May you continue to inspire us with your intelligence, creativity, and elegance.
        And may your heart be filled with warmth and love, today and always.</p>

<h4>Happy Birthday, dear sister! Here's to another year of making wonderful memories together.</h4>

<h5>With love and admiration,</h5>
